    @pi->string[matthias]{
      I explore all aspects of program design and programming language design.
      My current research involves work on behavioral software contracts,
      gradual typing of scripting languages, language interoperability,
      language extensibility, and module systems.
      I also engage in educational outreach work.
      For the past 20 years, I have worked with middle schools,
      high schools, after-school programs, and college faculty on
      injecting design ideas into mathematics and computer science courses.
      Such educational interactions often inspire our research,
      and many research efforts end up improving my educational work.
    }
    @pi->string[jan-vitek]{
      I work on the design and implementation of programming languages.
      I led the implementation of the first real-time Java virtual
      machine to be flight-tested.
      With Noble and Potter, I proposed what became known as Ownership Types.
      I tried to understand JavaScript by dynamic analysis and am
      now looking at supporting scalable data analysis in R.
    }
    @pi->string[jfoster]{
      I am a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Tufts
      University. The goal of my research is to develop fundamental new ways to
      make it easier to build more reliable, secure software. I am interested
      in programming languages, software engineering, and security. I am a
      member of TuPL.

      Previously, I was a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and
      UMIACS at the University of Maryland, College Park, as well as a member
      of PLUM.
    }
    @pi->string[sk]{
      Though my head is often in security, networking, verification,
      and HCI, my heart is in programming languages.
      Over the years I have contributed to several innovative and
      useful software systems: JavaScript and Web tools,
      Racket (formerly DrScheme), WeScheme, Margrave, Flapjax,
      FrTime, Continue, FASTLINK, and more.
    }
    @pi->string[jeremy-siek]{
      Associate Professor of Computer Science in the School of Informatics
      and Computing at Indiana University.
      Jeremy teaches courses in programming, programming languages, compilers,
      logic, and other areas of computer science.
      Jeremy designs new language features to help programmers create and
      use software libraries and domain-specific languages, especially generic
      and high-performance ones.
      In particular, Jeremy invented the gradual typing approach to mixing
      static and dynamic type checking within the same language.
      Prior to that, Jeremy authored the Boost Graph Library and attempted
      to add concepts to C++.
      Jeremy is a member of the Programming Languages Group at IU and the
      Center for Research in Extreme Scale Technologies.

    @pi->string[samth]{
      My research focuses on the design and implementation of
      programming systems.
      I'm particularly interested in programming languages that
      support the evolution of software.
      I primarily work on Racket and Typed Racket as well as with
      Mozilla Research on JavaScript.
