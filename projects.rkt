        Reticulated Python adds optional static and runtime typechecking
        to @a[href: "https://www.python.org"]{Python}.
        It lets programmers annotate functions and classes with types,
        and it enforces these types both before and during the execution
        of the program, providing early detection of errors.
        Crucially, Reticulated does not require that all parts of a
        program be given static types, or even any of it.
        In places where typed and untyped code interact @|---|
        for example, when an untyped variable is passed into a function
        whose argument type is @tt{Int} @|---| Reticulated can
        perform runtime checks ensure that the values in variables
        always correspond to their expected types, even when this
        cannot be guaranteed statically.
      }@p{
        Reticulated Python runs on both
        @a[href: "https://docs.python.org/3"]{Python 3} and
        @a[href: "https://docs.python.org/3"]{Python 2.7},
        although the type annotation syntax is different between the two versions.
        Reticulated on Python 3 uses the syntactic annotations provided
        by Python 3 as type annotations, while Reticulated on Python 2.7
        uses decorators to specify types.
        In both cases, the absence of an annotation implies that the
        parameters or return values are dynamically typed, as in
        standard Python.
        We also provide "type functions" for creating types that
        correspond to higher-order values in Python, like functions
        and lists, and we provide the type <tt>Dyn</tt> (for dynamic) to
        allow for, for example, heterogeneous lists, which have the
        type @tt{List(Dyn)}.
      }@p{
        Reticulated Python itself is written in Python
        (specifically, the subset of Python that is syntactically
        compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3).
        Its static, compile-time component is both a "linter" or
        static analyzer, and a source-to-source translator.
        This component parses source files (using the Python
        @a[href: "https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html"]{ast} package)
        and searches for type errors, rejecting programs that have
        statically detectable errors and syntactically inserting
        runtime checks or casts at boundaries between typed and
        untyped code, where type errors may occur.

    @(list @p{
            Grift is a gradually-typed language that was designed and implemented
            from scratch. In practice, most gradually-typed languages currently
            used in practice are designed by adding static typing to an existing
            language, e.g. Typed Racket for Racket, TypeScript and SafeTypeScript
            for JavaScript, Hack for PHP, Reticulated Python for Python, etc.
            However, adding static typing in a way that satisfies a strong notion
            of type soundness requires additions/modifications to the runtime
            system to do type checking when necessary at runtime. This is usually
            a source of performance inefficiency. For instance, Typed Racket used
            Racket's runtime contract system without modifications to maintain
            type soundness and it caused up to 100x slowdown as reported in their
            POPL 2016 paper. In Grift's compiler, the runtime system is completely
            designed with the goal to minimize the overhead of runtime checking
            for the gradually-typed language it implements.
      }@p{
        The compiler implements a variant of space-efficient coercions and
        space-efficient monotonic heap. Space-efficiency requires more work
        to be done when casting an already casted value at runtime which is
        typically some sort of composition/merging between the old and the new
        casts. On the other hand, it is much cheaper to access an already casted
        value because it is guaranteed to go through a single layer of checks
        instead of a chain of casts that is linear in the number of times this
        value has been casted before. Grift's runtime also represents values
        and types in a way that makes many operations on them that are related
        to runtime checking very efficient. Our self-comparison performance
        evaluation indicates that this approach increased performance
        substantially in comparison to our own implementation of the
        space-inefficient runtime. It also indicates that the overhead of doing
        composition/merging is not expensive. Furthermore, fully typed and fully
        untyped code is in the ball-park of OCaml, and Typed Racket, and of Chez
        Scheme, Gambit Scheme, and Racket respectively.
